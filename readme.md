## Build Instructions

These instructions leverage the power of Docker to create a reproducible build that works across different OS environments, one of the main ideas is to avoid problems caused by having a too old/new version of Linux being used the Yocto build system, as those can cause build failures.

Provided are both the `Dockerfile` and `Makefile` to simplify the build process.

Tested on Ubuntu 22.04

# Requirements
- Repo tool (from Google) - https://android.googlesource.com/tools/repo
- Docker - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ + https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user
- git name and email added to global scope
- STM32_Programmer_CLI - similar steps to [this](https://wiki.somlabs.com/index.php/Installing_STM32CubeProgrammer_on_Ubuntu_18.04) but use the latest release

# Method
1. Create a work directory, for example ~/work
    ```bash
    cd ~/work
    ```

2. Create project directory and enter it
    ```bash
    mkdir iotconnect-stm32mp17-kirkstone && cd iotconnect-stm32mp17-kirkstone
    ```

3. Use repo tool to get the yocto sources
    ```bash
    repo init -u https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/oe-manifest.git -b refs/tags/openstlinux-5.15-yocto-kirkstone-mp1-v23.07.26 && repo sync    
    ```

4.  wget provided Makefile and Dockerfile to project directory and execute these commands in the terminal
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akarnil/iotconnect-lora-demo/master/Makefile && \
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akarnil/iotconnect-lora-demo/master/Dockerfile

    git clone git@github.com:akarnil/iotconnect-lora-demo.git -b master ./layers/iotconnect-lora-demo
    cd ./layers/iotconnect-lora-demo
    git submodule update --init
    cd -

    make docker

    DISTRO=openstlinux-weston MACHINE=stm32mp1 source layers/meta-st/scripts/envsetup.sh
    # go through all of the EULA and accept everything
    
    exit
    
    make env
    bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/iotconnect-lora-demo/meta-iotconnect-lora-demo/
    bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/iotconnect-lora-demo/meta-st-stm32mpu-app-lorawan/

    exit

    make build
    # this will take a while as this is the initial build.
    ```

### Extras

1. To flash
    ```bash
    make flash
    ```
